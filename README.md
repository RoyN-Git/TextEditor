# TextEditor
This is a learning project from JetBrains Academy.
The program is a simple text editor, which can open, change and save files. It also can search in text (with regular expression in particular).
I have learned: 
1. Basics of multithreading in Java
2. Basics of Anonymous classes and Lyambdas
3. Input and output in Java
4. Swing
